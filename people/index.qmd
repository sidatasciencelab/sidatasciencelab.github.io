Rebecca Dikow is a Research Data Scientist and leads the Smithsonian Institution Data Science Lab. She has a B.S. in Biology from Cornell University and a Ph.D. in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Chicago. Her dissertation research focused on using whole-genome data to build evolutionary trees (phylogenies). After the completion of her Ph.D., she was the Biodiversity Genomics postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian. She is working with Smithsonian scientists to conduct biodiversity research, including genomics, informatics, and machine learning. She is also an affiliated faculty member in the George Mason University School of Systems Biology.

Mike is a Data Scientist and is a member of the Smithsonian Data Science Lab since 2018. Mike has a B.S. in Biological Sciences from Virginia Tech, and a Masters in Bioinformatics from Virginia Commonwealth University. Mike has been working with the Smithsonian since 2007, when he interned with the Smithsonian DNA Barcode Network, and then worked with them full-time until 2018 as their Informatics Lead. As part of the Data Science Lab, Mike will be working with Smithsonian partners on machine learning and visualization projects. He also leads the Smithsonian's partnership with the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) (formerly Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry), whose goal is to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers.

Alex White’s areas of scholarly expertise include statistical modeling in biogeography, quantitative ecology, ornithology, and community phylogenetics. Dr. White’s research focuses on how ecological and evolutionary forces (e.g., dispersal, range expansion, competition, and speciation) interact to mediate broad scale patterns of biodiversity and how those interactions are influenced by local ecological dynamics. Most of this research focuses on birds, though he compares avian patterns with those of other taxonomic groups including plants, mammals, and invertebrates. This work combines traditional methods in ecology and evolution with modern advances in statistics and computation, particularly those in machine learning and data science. As a Biodiversity Research Data Scientist in the Smithsonian Data Science Lab, he leads projects that leverage digitized museum collections as well as applications of computer hardware technology in edge uses of machine learning for field studies of animal and plant ecology. He is an Associate Editor for Ornithology.

Alex received his Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago, where he developed these and other questions to study the evolution and ecology of Himalayan birds.
