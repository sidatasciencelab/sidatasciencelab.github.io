Mirian Tsuchiya was the Smithsonian Women's Committee Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow. She has a B.S. in Biology from the Universidade Estadual de Londrina, an M.Sc. in Zoology from the Pontificia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Rio Grande do Sul and a Ph.D. in Environmental Science and Policy from the George Mason University. Her dissertation research focused on using whole genome sequencing, targeted enrichment of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and mitogenomes under a phylogenomics framework to assess questions regarding the biogeography, taxonomy, and evolutionary history of Neotropical mammals. Mirian worked on a variety of biodiversity genomics projects with the Data Science Lab and now an ORISE fellow at the Food and Drug Administration Center for Applied Food Safety.
