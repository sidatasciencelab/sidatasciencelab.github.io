Happy New Year from all of us at Real World Data Science. We hope you had a relaxing break over the holidays and are now refreshed and excited to see what 2023 has in store. We’re starting the year with a new addition to the site: a page dedicated to the excellent [RSS Data Science & AI Section newsletter](https://realworlddatascience.net/news-and-views/newsletter/). 

This monthly newsletter has been running since February 2020 and is well worth subscribing to as it features roundups of news, new developments, big picture ideas and practical tips.  

You’ll find the full list of past newsletters in our [**News and views**](https://realworlddatascience.net/news-and-views/) section (click the "Newsletter" heading in the section menu). If you want to subscribe to the newsletter, head over to [datasciencesection.org](https://datasciencesection.org/about/). The Data Science & AI Section also has a page on the [RSS website](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/data-science-section/).
