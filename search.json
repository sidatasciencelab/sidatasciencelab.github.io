    "text": "We were thrilled to be able to talk about our work at the American Women of Science Symposium #BecauseOfHerStory on October 22, 2020. We’d like to tell you a little more about the work we presented and some of what we are planning next. Our slides and data are on Figshare, but we also wanted to give some more context for the work we did.\nThis project is inspired by the Funk List. The Funk List is a crowd-sourced list of Smithsonian women in science that was started in part by Vicki Funk, a senior scientist and curator of botany at the National Museum of Natural History. The purpose of this list is to start the process of improving the presence of Smithsonian women online and make them more well-known. Vicki circulated this list to Smithsonian science units and departments and asked them to add the women that have been part of their branches of the Smithsonian since its beginning in 1846. Vicki unfortunately passed away a year ago, and after her death, the list was named in her honor. Since that time, Liz Harmon, American Women’s History Initiative Digital Curator has been continuing to add new women in science and the list is now at more than 400 women! Vicki was a collaborator and mentor of Rebecca’s and this photo by Mauricio Diazgranados captures her spirit so well. She inspired so many women to continue on in science and to keep pushing for change."

    "text": "Measuring Scientific Impact\nWhen we set out to work on this project, we started thinking about how we measure scientific impact. While there are obvious metrics like the number of peer-reviewed scientific papers, or discipline-specific awards, there is also service, public outreach, mentorship, and in particular for the Smithsonian, impact on the collections. Women in science often bear a larger burden of service and mentorship, which doesn’t often result in career advancement, even though they are essential for scientific progress and growth.\nWe will show initial results from two different data sources. First, the Smithsonian Annual Reports are just that, documents published annually, which give highlights of the Smithsonian year. Transcriptions of these going back to 1846 are available through the Biodiversity Heritage Library. We are using mentions in these reports as one measure of scientific impact. If someone is mentioned in an annual report, then something they did that year was notable to Smithsonian leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Title pages of the 1972 Smithsonian Annual Report."

    "text": "Methods & Results\nWe are also using Smithsonian Research Online or SRO, maintained by Smithsonian Libraries, which has all the citations for publications by Smithsonian authors. We were able to pull the data for each of the women on the Funk List via the SRO API.\nWe used a combination of natural language processing in spaCy and shell scripting to:\n\nExtract and count mentions of women on the Funk List in Annual Reports\nCount publications for women on the Funk List from Smithsonian Research Online\nExtract and count occurrences first names and words related to science in the Annual Reports\n\nWe decided to include all women from the Funk List that are no longer working at the Smithsonian and Annual Reports from 1846 up to and including 1999. Of the 127 women that remained, 12 are women of color, and one is a trans woman. We recognize that this list of 127 is already biased toward those most well-known around the Institution. It is our hope that by beginning to understand the level of visibility of these most prominent women in science, we will be able to start learning more about those never mentioned in the reports.\nThe first mention of a woman on our list was in the 1880 Annual Report. The number of total mentions increases steadily until 1984. Early in Smithsonian history, for example in the 1880s or 1890s, only one or two women from our list are mentioned per Annual Report. That number increases over time and it peaks in 1984, with 40 women being mentioned. There’s a sudden drop in the number of mentions in 1985, after which time the Annual Reports sharply decreased in length, from 694 pages in 1984 to 192 pages in 1985. Starting in 1991, the number of pages dropped again to around 100, and the reports also became much more visual. In the plots below, you can see the number of Annual Report mentions for all 127 women plotted over time, the number of Annual Reported mentions with the most-often mentioned women in each decade highlighted, and the publication counts plotted against the count of Annual Report mentions.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Who are the most prominent SI women in science by decade?\nWe started with 127 women and looked across 150 years of Annual Reports. If we look decade by decade, there are nine women in science who appear as the most prominent throughout Smithsonian history in terms of their presence in the Annual Reports.\n\nMatilda Stevenson was the most mentioned woman in the 1890s and early 1900s. She was from the Anthropology department at the National Museum of Natural History, and was the first woman employed by Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and the first president of the Women’s Anthropological Society of America. The National Anthropological Archives has more than 3300 photographs collected by Matilda.\nFrances Densmore is the most mentioned woman in four different decades (1910s, 1920s, 1940s, and 1950s)! She devoted over fifty years of her life to the study and preservation of Native American music. She collected thousands of song recordings, including twenty-four hundred transcribed songs.\n\n*In the 1930s, we have Mary Vaux Walcott. She was a botanical illustrator and a volunteer at Smithsonian. She was the wife of Charles D. Walcott, who was the fourth Secretary of the Smithsonian. Many times, Mary Walcott is simply referred to as Mrs. Charles Walcott, which complicates the task of giving proper attribution.\n*In the 1960s, we have Betty Jane Meggers. She was a research associate in the Anthropology Department at NMNH, and her studies focused on South American cultures.\n*In the 1970s, we have three women who were equally mentioned in the reports. Audrey Davis, from the National Museum of American History, Ursula Marvin, from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, and Marie-Hélène Sachet, from the National Museum of Natural History. It’s also the first time we have women with the title of Curator as a top-mentioned woman.\n*In the 1980s, Devra Kleiman from the National Zoo, is the most mentioned woman in the Annual Reports. She helped create the field of Conservation Biology and her research helped save the Golden Lion Tamarin from extinction. She also helped change the way pandas were housed at the zoo, and thanks to her, Tai Shan, the first panda born at the National Zoo to survive longer than a few days was born in 2005.\n*Finally, in 1990s, we have Jessie Cohen, a photographer at the National Zoo. She is represented in the reports by the images she captured of the animals and exhibits at the National Zoo. This also coincides with the reports becoming more visual, with images becoming more important to represent the most significant events of the year.\nIt is important to note that all of the women mentioned so far are white. There are also women who were firsts in their fields such as Sophie Lutterlough and Margaret Collins, both African American women, who have very few or no mentions in the data sources we considered. We have a lot of work to do in order to make their stories more central to Smithsonian science. The take-home message of our work is that we are just starting to scratch the surface of the women’s contributions at the Smithsonian Institution. We are beginning to understand the patterns and trends based on the notable women we know more about. We have not yet fully explored the context of the Annual Report mentions and how these may have changed over time. We also hope that by including more data sources in future work, we will be able to unveil new stories and give credit to those women that helped shape the Smithsonian history but are not as of yet well known."

    "text": "A look at broad patterns in the Annual Reports\nWhile our main question in this project was about women from the Funk List, we are also interested to learn more about how the Annual Reports have changed over time. Here, we present some very early work to that end. First, we were interested in knowing what were the most common first names mentioned in annual reports through time. These data are only instances where first names are spelled out, not just as initials, so it’s not complete first name data, but provides an interesting snapshot. Here are the top 10 names for each of 4 timepoints: 1920, 1950, 1970, and 1990. It is interesting, but perhaps not surprising, that these are all traditionally men’s names, and that out of 40 possible top names (10 in each year), there are only 16 total names. Men’s first names that were common in the 1990 annual report were largely the same names common in 1920.\nSince there were no traditionally women’s names in the top 10, we thought we would explicitly look for the top 10 traditionally women’s names in the same 4 reports. We then counted the total number of mentions of these top 10 first names, and this is what you see plotted here. You can see that in 1920, about 10% of these total mentions are traditionally women’s names and by 1990, this percentage is slightly better, but nowhere near equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Plots of common first names in four different Annual Reports.\n\nWe can also look at word counts for particular words of interest across the reports. Here, we extracted the top 100 nouns for all the reports (stop words were removed). We plotted occurrences of different sets of words from this set of top 100 for each report.\n\nFirst, the words research and collections. As you might imagine, these are two of the most common words in the reports.\nWe also looked at the words man, woman, male, and female. This was quite striking to, that woman occurs so rarely in the top 100 nouns across the Annual Reports. We have to do more work to understand the context of these mentions, but we do know that often the word man has been historically used in ways like: mankind, manned spacecraft, seemingly to represent all humans, in ways that are now considered exclusionary of women.\nFinally, we chose a set common science words and looked at their usage over time. Again, it will be interesting to look at the contexts for these mentions and how those have changed over time as science itself evolved and changed.\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.

    "text": "As the Smithsonian makes substantial progress digitizing collections across its museums, research centers, archives, and libraries, we have the opportunity to apply computational tools to elevate research and enable discovery and the potential to surface stories of those previously unrecognized for their contributions to the Smithsonian. For the American Women’s History Initiative, this work is integral to the task of quantifying the contribution of women over the Smithsonian’s history and is a step toward making the necessary changes to ensure fuller participation of all communities to the future of the Smithsonian.\nIn the summer of 2019, the Data Science Lab hosted Tiana Curry, a senior at UCSB studying Mathematics and Statistics. Tiana’s project focused on examining Smithsonian women in science on the Funk List. She used this list to hone her data science skills - producing maps of specimens and collections attributed to different Smithsonian women in science and plotting start dates and job titles for these women in science over time. One particular find that Tiana made about natural historian, botanist, and artist Mary Vaux Walcott, highlights some of the challenges that are particular to surfacing women’s stories.\n\n\n\n\nTiana Curry\n\n\n\nMary Vaux Walcott (born Mary Morris Vaux; July 31, 1860 - August 22, 1940) was an avid outdoors person and artist with particular interests in geology and botany. She married paleontologist and 4th Secretary to the Smithsonian Charles D. Walcott in 1914. Mary spent years traveling throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico, collecting plants and painting them.\n\n\n\n\nMary Vaux Walcott, 1914. Smithsonian Libraries and Archives\n\n\n\nThere are hundreds of specimens collected by Mary Vaux Walcott in the US National Herbarium from 1915 until her death and many illustrations and paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. In 1925, the Smithsonian published several hundred of her plant illustrations in North American Wild Flowers, available digitally via the Biodiversity Heritage Library.\n\n\n\n\nThistle specimen and illustration by MV Walcott\n\n\n\nThe thistle (genus Cirsium: Asteraceae) shown above left was collected by Mary Vaux Walcott in the Grand Canyon that was the basis for the illustration on the right. Specimen from the US National Herbarium, illustration from the Smithsonian American Art Museum, both available Open Access, license CC0. High resolution image at the bottom of the post.\nDuring the late 1800 and early 1900s, it was common for women to serve in a volunteer capacity to their husbands and brothers at the Smithsonian. With that knowledge, when researching the contributions of early women in science, we routinely search collections databases not only for the woman’s name, but also her husband’s or brother’s name to capture in full her contribution. Perhaps she would be listed as a co-collector rather than primary, or in the notes field rather in the collector field.\nWhen Tiana queried the NMNH Botany collections database for all specimens collected by a “Walcott,” she noticed that there were dozens of collections attributed to Charles Walcott (mostly as C. D. Walcott) that had occurred after his death (1927). In order to find out what was going on, we downloaded the digital images of the specimens. As we examined the images, we had a big aha moment: the cursive on the labels showed the collector was written as “Mrs. C. D. Walcott.” These are specimens collected by Mary Vaux Walcott but attributed to her husband. During the transcription process, titles (Mr., Mrs., Dr.) are often removed because they are generally unimportant - we are interested in the collector’s name, not their title. In this case, it is also challenging to distinguish Mr. and Mrs. written in cursive on the original labels.\n\n\n\n\nWalcott specimen labels\n\n\n\nThe above labels, which are present in the lower right corner of herbarium sheets, are representative of the different ways Mary Vaux Walcott’s name is written on specimen labels as well as some that are collected by C. D. Walcott himself. Mary Vaux Walcott is referred to as Mrs. Walcott, Mrs. C. D. Walcott, Mrs. Chas. D. Walcott, Mrs. Charles D. Walcott, and Mary Vaux Walcott. There is also at least one Mrs. Walcott collection from 1893, which is likely C. D. Walcott’s 2nd wife, Helena. Another notable specimen lists both Mrs. C. D. Walcott and Mrs. Herbert Hoover as collectors, from 1934. High resolution image at the bottom of the post.\nFurther exploration of those botany specimens revealed dozens of additional instances where specimens labeled in cursive with Mrs. C. D. Walcott were present in the database as C. D. Walcott, as well as the many different ways Mary Vaux Walcott’s name was written on her specimen labels. We were very fortunate to have access to not only the digital metadata records for these specimens, but also the images that capture even more of their history. The National Museum of Natural History, in collaboration with the Smithsonian Digitization Program Office, has digitized more than half of the 5 million specimens in the herbarium. Without these digital images, we would have had to spend hours in the herbarium to find these specimens to take a closer look.\nCollections digitization presents museum professionals with the unprecedented ability to make collections accessible to the public, as well as open new lines of research. But without Tiana’s careful eye looking at every entry in a spreadsheet (and the fact that she had spent many hours reading about both Mary Vaux Walcott’s and Charles D. Walcott’s lives), we would not have noticed the discrepancy of collections dates and we would not have found these additional collections to attribute to Mary Vaux Walcott.\nWe are left both encouraged that digitized collections can provide us new opportunities to dive into our data, but also keenly aware that surfacing women’s stories will remain complicated. Mary Vaux Walcott was a well-known woman around the Smithsonian, who lived a privileged life. What about those women whose names we don’t yet know? We look forward to uncovering many more women’s stories as we dive even deeper.\nRebecca leads the Data Science Lab and Megan is a student in the Digital Public Humanities program at George Mason University.\nContact us on Twitter: @SIDataScience\nWe would like to acknowledge Effie Kapsalis, Liz Harmon, Heidi Stover, Mirian Tsuchiya, Mike Trizna, Smithsonian Digitization Program Office, Smithsonian Women’s Committee, and the National Museum of Natural History."
